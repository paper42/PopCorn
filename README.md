PopCorn
=======

PopCorn is the statistics system for XBPS based Linux systems.  It
allows package maintainers to know what packages are in use and what
versions, and it allows maintainers to know what systems are out there
based on the `xuname` output that is included in the stats updates.

PopCorn is called PopCorn because years ago when I was installing
Debian I misread the name of the `popcon` package as popcorn.  The
idea stuck with me and since this fulfills a similar function, it
seemed like a fine name.

PopCorn is provided purely on an opt-in basis, if you find that
somehow you got PopCorn and didn't ask for it, contact your system
administrator as soon as possible, and if you are the system
administrator, contact the Void Linux leadership as soon as possible.
